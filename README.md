# Home Assistant Blueprints

This repository contains blueprints for Home Assistant automation.

## Blueprints

- *added_todo_notification.yaml*:  
  Sends a notification when an item is added to a to-do list and notifies specific users.

- *recurring_todo.yaml*:  
  Adds calendar events to your to-do list and notifies specific users when this happens.  
  By leveraging recurring calendar events, you can easily create recurring to-do items.

- *todo_completed_notification.yaml*:
  Sends a notification whenever an item in a to-do list is completed. The notification can include the completed item's name and the user who completed it.
